Mint NFTs:
To mint NFTs, you'll need to use a blockchain platform that supports NFTs. Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for minting NFTs, and you can use tools like OpenSea, Rarible, or Mintable to facilitate the minting process.

a. Set up an Ethereum Wallet:
You need an Ethereum wallet to receive and manage your NFTs. MetaMask is a popular choice for this purpose.

b. Create NFTs:
Using one of the NFT minting platforms mentioned above, you can upload your character images, set metadata (e.g., name, description), and specify the number of NFTs you want to mint (in this case, 3000).

c. Pay Gas Fees:
Minting NFTs on the Ethereum network involves gas fees. Ensure you have enough Ether (ETH) in your wallet to cover these fees.

Deploy a Smart Contract:
To allow NFT owners to change the image associated with their NFTs, you'll need to create a custom smart contract. Solidity is the most commonly used programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Below is an example of a simple Solidity smart contract to handle this functionality:
Interact with the Smart Contract:
Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain. You can do this using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

Allow NFT Owners to Change Images:
NFT owners can interact with the smart contract to change the image associated with their NFTs by calling the changeImage function, providing the token ID and the new image URI.

Launch Your NFT Collection:
Once everything is set up and tested, you can start promoting and selling your NFT collection to enthusiasts who share your love for the selected television characters.
